    <h2>Certificate of EKG Technician</h2>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p>
      An EKG Technician is a member of the health care team whose primary duty
      is the taking of EKGs on patients. An EKG measures the electrical activity
      of the heart and can be used to diagnose a range of many heart diseases.
    </p>

    <h3>The principal responsibilities of an EKG technician are as follows:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Set up and administer EKGs (electrocardiograms) and stress tests.</li>
      <li>Prepare patients for Holter or ambulatory monitoring.</li>
      <li>Edit and deliver final test results to physicians for analysis.</li>
      <li>Perform Holter monitor processing and schedule appointments.</li>
      <li>
        Ensure the patient is comfortable and informed about the procedure.
      </li>
      <li>Monitor the patient's physical condition during the test.</li>
      <li>
        Troubleshoot and maintain EKG equipment to ensure accurate readings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      EKG technicians work in hospitals, physicians' offices, and other health
      care facilities. As the population ages, the demand for EKG technicians is
      expected to grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      More and more employers require a professional EKG technician
      certification.
    </p>

    <h3>Necessary requirements:</h3>
    <p>
      Graduation from High School (or equivalent), and graduation from an
      approved EKG program within the last 5 years.
    </p>

    <p>Or</p>

    <p>1-year verifiable work experience as an EKG Technician.</p>

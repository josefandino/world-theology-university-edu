              <strong>Specific practicum requirements:</strong> Students must
              complete a supervised practicum in a mental health setting, which
              generally involves at least 100 hours of practical experience. To
              begin the practicum, students must have completed the program’s
              core courses and have approval from the department. Additionally,
              they must submit an acceptance letter from an approved practicum
              site.

        >
        allows students to examine interventions aimed at improving mental
        illness and promoting psychological well-being. Research and treatment
        models are integrated to consider mental well-being in terms of
        pathology and optimal psychological and physical development. The
        meanings of health and illness across various identities (such as
        ethnicity, culture, gender, sexuality, class, and age) are explored,
        along with disorders such as depression, anxiety, and psychosis,
        alongside constructs such as resilience, hope, wisdom, and spirituality.

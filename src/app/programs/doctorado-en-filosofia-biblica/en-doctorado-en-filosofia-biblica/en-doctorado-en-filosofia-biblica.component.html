            and cultural diversity. The Doctorate in Biblical Philosophy at

            understanding of religious phenomena worldwide. This global and
            inclusive perspective is fundamental for those students who seek to
            work in multicultural contexts, whether in academia, international
            organizations, or leadership roles within their own communities.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Doctoral Program in Biblical Philosophy at the Divinity School
            of World Theology University (World Theology University) requires
            candidates to meet a series of prerequisites to ensure that students
            possess a solid foundation in religious studies or related fields.
            These requirements ensure that students are prepared to engage at
            the advanced academic level demanded by the program and can fully
            benefit from the research and academic development opportunities
            offered by the doctorate.
          </p>

          <h3>Previous Academic Background</h3>
          <p>
            To be considered for the Doctorate in Biblical Philosophy,
            candidates must hold a master's degree in religious studies,
            theology, philosophy, or a related discipline. This requirement is
            fundamental as it ensures that students have adequate knowledge of
            the key disciplines and research methodologies needed to conduct
            advanced studies in biblical philosophy. Students from other
            disciplines may be considered, provided they can demonstrate a
            strong foundation in subjects related to religious or philosophical
            studies.
          </p>

          <h3>Research Proposal</h3>
          <p>
            Applicants to the program must submit a detailed research proposal
            aligned with the objectives of the doctorate. This proposal should
            address a relevant topic within the field of biblical or
            philosophical studies, demonstrating the candidate's ability to
            develop original and meaningful research. The proposal must include
            a description of the research problem, specific objectives, the

            academic research.
          </p>

          <h3>Proficiency in Relevant Languages</h3>
          <p>
            Since many of the biblical and philosophical texts studied in the
            program are in ancient languages, students are required to have
            advanced proficiency in at least one language relevant to biblical
            or philosophical studies. The most common languages are Hebrew,
            Greek, and Latin, although other ancient or modern languages may be
            considered depending on the student's research focus. This
            requirement ensures that students can access and analyze primary
            sources in their original language, which is essential for
            conducting precise and rigorous research in biblical studies.
          </p>

          <h3>Research Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Candidates are expected to have prior experience in academic
            research, preferably in areas related to philosophy, theology, or
            biblical studies. This experience may have been gained through the
            completion of a master's thesis, the publication of academic
            articles, or participation in research projects. Previous research
            experience demonstrates the student's ability to conduct independent
            and rigorous studies, a critical skill for successfully completing a
            doctorate.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Hold a master’s degree in religious studies or a related
              discipline.
            </li>

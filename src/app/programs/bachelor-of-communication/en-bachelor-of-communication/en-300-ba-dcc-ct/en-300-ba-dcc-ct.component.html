      <p>
        Major communication theories: structuralism, functionalism, and critical theories.
      </p>

      <p>
        The course <em>Communication Theory I</em> offers an in-depth exploration of the key theoretical approaches that have shaped the study of communication. It examines structuralist, functionalist, and critical schools of thought, considering their historical context, principal figures, and influence on our understanding of communicative phenomena. This course provides students with the conceptual foundations necessary to interpret, evaluate, and apply communication theories in contemporary academic and professional settings.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the conceptual foundations of major communication theories.</li>
        <li>Critically analyze structuralist, functionalist, and critical perspectives in communication studies.</li>
        <li>Relate communication theories to specific historical, cultural, and social contexts.</li>
        <li>Identify key contributions of major theorists from each tradition.</li>
        <li>Apply theoretical approaches to the analysis of current communicative phenomena.</li>
        <li>Develop critical and argumentative skills regarding the role of communication in society.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Main Topics:</strong></p>
      <ul>

      <p><strong>Methodology:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The course will be delivered in a virtual format, promoting critical analysis and deep reflection through:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lectures combining expert presentation with student participation.</li>
        <li>Reading and discussion of foundational texts from each theoretical approach.</li>
        <li>Case studies of communicative phenomena analyzed through various theoretical lenses.</li>
        <li>Academic discussion forums for the exchange of ideas and arguments.</li>
        <li>Development of critical essays on selected topics.</li>
        <li>Final project involving theoretical analysis of a real-world communication case.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Assessment:</strong></p>
      <p>The comprehensive assessment of the course will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Critical essay (30%): Comparative analysis of two theoretical traditions applied to a communication phenomenon.</li>
        <li>Case analysis (20%): Application of a specific theory to a media study.</li>
        <li>Active forum participation (15%): Thoughtful and well-supported arguments.</li>
        <li>Written test (15%): Evaluation of key theoretical concepts.</li>
        <li>Final project (20%): Integrated analysis of a current issue using studied theoretical frameworks.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Course Significance:</strong></p>
      <p>
        <em>Communication Theory I</em> is essential for developing a critical and profound understanding of the communication field. Through rigorous study of foundational theories, students gain the ability to analyze complex communicative phenomena, comprehend their structural and functional dynamics, and critically assess the social processes that shape them. This knowledge strengthens their professional, academic, and ethical performance in a constantly evolving world.

  <h2>BADN-PhN-600 – Pharmacology for Nursing I</h2>
  <div class="line"></div>
  <section class="content fadeIn">
    <p>
      Intensive 105-hour course (30 synchronous, 45 asynchronous, 30
      laboratory/simulation) for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Introduces
      the principles of pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism,
      excretion) and pharmacodynamics (mechanisms of action, therapeutic and
      adverse effects) as applied to clinical practice. Emphasizes medication
      safety through mastery of dosage calculation, application of the “rights”
      of administration (patient, drug, dose, route, time, indication,
      documentation, response, and education), and medication reconciliation.
      Aligned with safe practice recommendations from the Institute for
      Healthcare Improvement (IHI) and hospital standards, it integrates
      simulation of administration, alert management, and error prevention,
      strengthening professional responsibility and the patient safety culture.

        <strong>Purpose and scope:</strong> Provide a solid foundation in
        applied pharmacology for nursing, ensuring that professionals can
        administer medications safely, accurately, and knowledgeably, minimizing
        risks and improving therapeutic effectiveness.

      <li>
        <strong>Workload and modality:</strong> 105 total hours (30h live
        classes with experts, 45h self-directed study, 30h practice and
        simulation). Online modality with dosage calculation workshops,
        administration simulations, case analysis of medication errors, and
        medication reconciliation in simulated hospital environments.

          identify   adverse reactions and side effects
          to act according to safety protocols  .<br />
        6) Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to
          document   completely and accurately the administration and
        observed effects   in simulated clinical records  .

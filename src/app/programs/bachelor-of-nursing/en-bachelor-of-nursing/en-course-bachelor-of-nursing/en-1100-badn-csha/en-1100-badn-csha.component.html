  <section class="content fadeIn">
    <p>
      Intensive 105-hour course (30 synchronous, 45 asynchronous, 30
      practice/simulation) for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Provides
      systematic training in the competencies required to conduct an effective
      clinical interview, perform a system-based physical examination, and
      record findings in standardized clinical formats, integrating legal and
      quality criteria into documentation. Consolidates the ability to collect
      and organize relevant data to formulate accurate nursing diagnoses
      (NANDA-I), plan care based on NIC interventions, and evaluate outcomes
      using NOC indicators, thereby strengthening clinical judgment and safe
      decision-making.

        <strong>Purpose and scope:</strong> Prepare students to conduct
        comprehensive clinical assessments, establish evidence-based nursing
        diagnoses, and develop person-centered care plans that address physical,
        psychosocial, cultural, and spiritual aspects.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Workload and modality:</strong> 105 total hours (30h live
        classes, 45h self-directed study, 30h laboratory practice and clinical
        simulation). Online modality with interview workshops, physical
        examination labs, and practice in simulated electronic health records
        (EHR).
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Learning outcomes (measurable):</strong><br />
        1) Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to
          conduct   complete clinical interviews
          following structured guidelines  
          with rubric ≥4/5  .<br />
        2) Perform a system-based physical examination
        <em
          >using inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation
          techniques</em
        >
          with checklist ≥90%  .<br />
        3) Record clinical findings in standardized formats and EHR
          meeting legal and quality criteria  .<br />
        4) Integrate subjective and objective data
          to formulate NANDA-I nursing diagnoses  .<br />
        5) Develop care plans based on NIC interventions and NOC outcomes
          aligned with clinical priorities  .<br />
        6) Evaluate the effectiveness of care
          using outcome indicators  
          and make adjustments according to patient progress  .

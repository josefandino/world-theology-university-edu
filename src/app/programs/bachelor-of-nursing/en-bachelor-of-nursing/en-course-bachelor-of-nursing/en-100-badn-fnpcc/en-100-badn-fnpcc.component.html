  <h2>BADN-FNPCC-100 – Fundamentals of Nursing and Person-Centered Care</h2>
  <div class="line"></div>
  <section class="content fadeIn">
    <p>
      Intensive 105-hour course (30 synchronous, 45 asynchronous, 30
      practice/simulation) for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, introducing
      nursing models and theories, the professional role, and the principles of
      safety and quality of care. Aligned with the standards of the
      International Council of Nurses (ICN) and QSEN competencies, it develops
      person-centered care with a biopsychosocial and spiritual approach,
      effective therapeutic communication, and standardized clinical
      documentation (SOAP/DAR and simulated EHR use). Through case studies and
      basic simulation, students integrate humanistic values, cultural
      competence (attention to diversity and interculturality), and ethical
      discernment for real-world clinical practice in contemporary health care
      systems.

        <strong>Purpose and scope:</strong> Establish the professional
        foundations of nursing around person-centered care, integrating nursing
        theories (Nightingale, Orem, Roy, Watson, Pender), ethics and the ICN
        code, patient safety and quality culture (QSEN), SBAR communication,
        clinical documentation, and initial use of the electronic health record
        (EHR) in simulated settings.

      <li>
        <strong>Workload and modality:</strong> 105 total hours (30h synchronous
        classes with experts, 45h guided/asynchronous study, 30h
        simulation/OSCE-lite and skills lab). 100% online modality with live
        sessions, guided practical activities, and one-on-one mentoring with
        formative feedback.

          apply   patient safety measures (identification, hand hygiene,
        fall prevention)
          in simulated scenarios  
          meeting QSEN checklist ≥90%  .<br />
        3) Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to
          document   assessment and care plans
          in SOAP/DAR formats and simulated EHR  
          with ≥90% accuracy according to rubric  .<br />
        4) Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to
          integrate   therapeutic communication and SBAR
          in patient-team interactions  
          maintaining performance ≥4/5  .<br />
        5) Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to
          assess   biopsychosocial and spiritual needs using FICA/HOPE
          during initial admission  
          demonstrating cultural competence ≥4/5  .<br />
        6) Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to
          design   a care plan for prevalent conditions (e.g., acute pain)
          in primary care settings  
          aligned with NANDA-I, NOC, and NIC  .<br />
        7) Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to
          demonstrate   aseptic technique, infection control, and vital
        signs measurement   in the skills lab  
          passing OSCE ≥80%  .<br />
        8) Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to
          critically reflect   on professional ethics, boundaries, and
        self-care   in high-demand settings  
          proposing evidence-based strategies  .

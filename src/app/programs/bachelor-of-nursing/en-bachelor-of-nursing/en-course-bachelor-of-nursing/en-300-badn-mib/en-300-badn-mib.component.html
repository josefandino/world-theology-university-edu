  <h2>BADN-MIB-300 – Microbiology, Immunology, and Biosafety</h2>
  <div class="line"></div>
  <section class="content fadeIn px-1">
    <p>
      Intensive 105-hour course (30 synchronous, 45 asynchronous, 30
      laboratory/simulation) for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Covers the
      main groups of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites),
      transmission routes, and the foundations of innate and adaptive immune
      responses, with clinical correlation for decision-making in infection
      prevention and control (IPC). Integrates WHO/CDC guidelines and essential
      biosafety practices: hand hygiene (5 moments), correct use of PPE (donning
      and doffing), standard and transmission-based precautions (contact,
      droplet, airborne), cleaning–disinfection–sterilization (Spaulding
      classification), waste and sharps management, specimen handling, and
      healthcare-associated infection (HAI) surveillance. Through basic
      simulation, guided audits, and case studies, it strengthens critical
      competencies for patient safety, staff protection, and quality of care in
      intercultural and digital contexts (simulated EHR, checklists, and
      debriefing).

      <li>
        <strong>Purpose and scope:</strong> Establish a solid
        microbiological–immunological foundation to support safe decision-making
        in clinical environments, standardizing IPC practices aligned with
        WHO/CDC and a patient safety culture (QSEN) to reduce HAI and
        occupational transmission risks.

        donning/doffing role-play, hand hygiene audits, outbreak simulators, and
        structured debriefing.

  <section class="content fadeIn">
    <p>
      Intensive 105-hour course (30 synchronous, 45 asynchronous, 30
      laboratory/simulation) for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Provides an
      in-depth study of the endocrine, renal, digestive, and reproductive
      systems, with emphasis on pathophysiological correlation and the
      anatomical–functional integration required for clinical decision-making.
      Addresses the structure and function of organs and tissues, as well as
      regulatory mechanisms and responses to alterations, to support care
      prioritization and patient education. Combines theoretical foundations,
      clinical case analysis, and practical activities that promote the
      application of knowledge in hospital and community settings, with a
      preventive and health promotion approach.

      <li>
        <strong>Purpose and scope:</strong> Consolidate and expand the
        anatomical and physiological knowledge acquired in Anatomy and
        Physiology I, integrating common pathophysiological processes affecting
        the systems studied, to enhance assessment, prioritization, and nursing
        care planning skills.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Workload and modality:</strong> 105 total hours (30h live
        classes with experts, 45h self-directed study, 30h laboratory and
        simulation). Online modality with interactive resources, 3D atlases,
        imaging studies, and clinical simulations.

        <strong>Learning outcomes (measurable):</strong><br />
        1) Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to
          describe   the anatomy and physiology of the endocrine, renal,
        digestive, and reproductive systems   with ≥90% accuracy  .<br />
        2) Analyze hormonal regulation, fluid–electrolyte balance, digestion,
        and reproduction
          in relation to clinical practice  .<br />
        3) Identify common pathophysiological alterations
          in the systems studied  
          relating them to signs and symptoms  .<br />
        4) Apply anatomical–functional integration to prioritize care
          in simulated scenarios  
          achieving performance ≥4/5  .<br />
        5) Educate patients and families
        <em
          >about functions, preventive care, and management of common
          conditions</em
        >.<br />
        6) Interpret basic related diagnostic tests (hormones, renal function,
        digestive and reproductive studies)
          to support decision-making  .

        anatomical atlas; interpretation of diagnostic studies; collaborative
        work and personalized mentoring.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Assessment system:</strong> Theoretical–practical exam on
        anatomy and physiology (30%); Clinical case analysis with
        pathophysiological correlation (25%); Clinical simulation evaluation and
        care prioritization (25%); Participation in forums and practical
        activities (10%); Quizzes and follow-up exercises (10%).
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Resources and tools:</strong> LMS with interactive anatomical
        atlas; study guides; clinical case bank; physiological simulators;
        imaging resources (ultrasound, CT, MRI); patient education templates.

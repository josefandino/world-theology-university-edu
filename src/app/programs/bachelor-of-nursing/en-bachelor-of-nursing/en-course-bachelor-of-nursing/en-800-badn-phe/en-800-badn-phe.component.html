  <section class="content fadeIn">
    <p>
      Intensive 105-hour course (30 synchronous, 45 asynchronous, 30 applied
      work) for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Introduces the foundations
      of public health and epidemiology, addressing the social determinants of
      health, levels of prevention (primary, secondary, tertiary), and the
      analysis of population health indicators. Explores the relationship
      between health policies, healthcare systems, and community practice,
      preparing students to design, implement, and evaluate interventions with
      an impact on both local and global health. The course emphasizes the
      integration of intercultural and evidence-based approaches, as well as
      understanding disease burden, epidemiological surveillance, and health
      promotion as core pillars of community-centered care.

        <strong>Purpose and scope:</strong> Provide students with the knowledge
        and skills to analyze population health status, interpret
        epidemiological indicators, and apply preventive and health promotion
        strategies that improve health outcomes, considering social, cultural,
        environmental, and economic factors.
      </li>

        <strong>Learning outcomes (measurable):</strong><br />
        1) Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to
          describe   the social determinants of health
          and their impact on population well-being  
          with ≥90% accuracy  .<br />
        2) Apply the levels of prevention
          in community cases and programs  
          with performance ≥4/5  .<br />
        3) Interpret health indicators (mortality, morbidity, life expectancy)
          using official sources  
          with ≥90% accuracy  .<br />
        4) Analyze health policies and plans
          to propose evidence-based community interventions  .<br />
        5) Design a community intervention proposal
          with a preventive focus  
          aligned with local and global health goals  .<br />
        6) Evaluate the impact of an intervention
          using epidemiological indicators  
          and sustainability criteria  .

  <section class="content fadeIn">
    <p>
      Intensive 105-hour course (30 synchronous, 45 asynchronous, 30
      laboratory/simulation) for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Examines
      body organization, levels of organization (cells, tissues, organs, and
      systems), and provides in-depth study of the neuromuscular,
      cardiovascular, and respiratory systems with clinical correlation.
      Develops biomedical terminology, anatomical–functional reasoning, and
      initial judgment for assessment, preparing students for practice scenarios
      and OSCE-type examinations. The curriculum integrates patient safety,
      hygiene, and ergonomics, as well as basic examination skills (inspection,
      palpation, percussion, and auscultation) using digital resources (3D
      atlas, virtual microscopy, ECG simulators, and cardiopulmonary sound
      simulators) and brief documentation of findings in standardized clinical
      formats.

        <strong>Purpose and scope:</strong> Build structural and functional
        understanding of the human body to support assessment and care decisions
        in Nursing I; emphasis on anatomical terminology, planes and axes, basic
        histology, introductory neurophysiology, muscle physiology,
        hemodynamics, and ventilatory mechanics, with application to common
        cases (chest pain, dyspnea, muscle weakness, syncope).

        <strong>Workload and modality:</strong> 105 total hours (30h live
        classes with demonstrations, 45h guided/asynchronous study, 30h
        laboratory and simulation/OSCE-lite). Online modality with interactive
        sessions, guided practice in the virtual lab, and mentoring with
        formative feedback.

  <section class="content fadeIn">
    <p>
      Intensive 105-hour course (30 synchronous, 45 asynchronous, 30
      laboratory/simulation) for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Reviews the
      main high-prevalence therapeutic groups in clinical practice (analgesics,
      antimicrobials, antihypertensives, antidiabetics, anticoagulants, among
      others) and the management of high-alert medications according to
      international lists (e.g., ISMP). Develops competencies for active
      monitoring of adverse reactions, detection of drug interactions, and
      patient and family education in both chronic and acute care contexts. The
      course emphasizes the application of pharmacovigilance protocols, accurate
      clinical documentation, and interprofessional communication to ensure
      patient safety.

        <strong>Purpose and scope:</strong> Strengthen the student's
        pharmacological knowledge of the most frequently used therapeutic groups
        and the safe handling of high-alert medications, promoting
        evidence-based clinical practice and the prevention of medication
        errors.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Workload and modality:</strong> 105 total hours (30h live master
        classes, 45h self-directed study and guideline analysis, 30h clinical
        laboratory/simulation). Online modality with practical workshops, safe
        administration simulations, and patient education activities.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Learning outcomes (measurable):</strong><br />
        1) Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to
          describe   the pharmacology of the main high-prevalence
        therapeutic groups   with ≥90% accuracy  .<br />
        2) Identify high-alert medications and   apply   specific safety
        measures
          in clinical simulations  
          with checklist ≥90%  .<br />
        3) Detect and   document   adverse reactions and drug interactions
          following pharmacovigilance protocols  .<br />
        4) Educate patients and their families
          on the safe use of medications  
          in acute and chronic contexts  .<br />
        5) Evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment
          using clinical and laboratory criteria  .<br />
        6) Collaborate with the interdisciplinary team
          to optimize pharmacological therapy  .

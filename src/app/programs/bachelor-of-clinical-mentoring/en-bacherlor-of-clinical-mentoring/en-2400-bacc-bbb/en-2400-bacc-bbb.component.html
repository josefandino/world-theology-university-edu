    <h2>BACC-BBB-2400 - Biological Bases of Behavior</h2>
    <div class="line"></div>

    <div class="content fadeIn">
      <p>
        The course <span>Biological Bases of Behavior</span> provides an
        understanding of the neurobiological foundations that influence human
        behavior. The nervous and endocrine systems are studied, as well as
        their relationship with emotions, perception, learning, and mental
        disorders.
      </p>

      <h3>Course Objectives:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the structure and function of the nervous system.</li>
        <li>Explore how biological processes affect human behavior.</li>
        <li>Analyze the influence of neurotransmitters on mental health.</li>
        <li>
          Understand the relationship between biology, emotions, and behavior.
        </li>
        <li>Relate neurobiological knowledge to clinical approaches.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Main Topics:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic neuroanatomy and brain functions.</li>
        <li>Neurotransmitters and their impact on behavior.</li>
        <li>Endocrine system and its relationship with emotions.</li>
        <li>Relationship between biology and psychological disorders.</li>
        <li>Brain plasticity and human development.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Methodology:</h3>
      <p>
        The course combines theoretical classes, review of scientific
        literature, clinical case analysis, and audiovisual resources. Active
        learning is promoted through discussion forums and practical observation
        activities.
      </p>

      <h3>Assessment:</h3>
      <p>The course assessment will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Written tests on neurobiology and behavior.</li>
        <li>Essays on the link between biology and mental health.</li>
        <li>Case studies on disorders with a neurobiological basis.</li>
        <li>Participation in practical activities and discussions.</li>
        <li>Final project integrating course content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Importance of the Course:</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding the biological bases of behavior allows for a more
        comprehensive and accurate clinical approach. This knowledge is key to
        developing effective interventions in counseling and psychology, and for
        improving the treatment of mental disorders from a multidisciplinary
        perspective.
